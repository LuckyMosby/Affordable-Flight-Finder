# Affordable-Flight-Finder
This project is a Python-based application designed to help users find affordable flights based on a user-defined price threshold. It integrates with the Skyscanner API to search for flights, redirects users to the Skyscanner website for booking, and sends automated email notifications when flights under the specified threshold are found.
